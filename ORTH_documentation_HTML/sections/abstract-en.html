The need of a common ontology for describing orthology information
in biological research communities has led to the creation of the Orthology Ontology (ORTH)
 on the basis of the best practices in ontology engineering. 
 ORTH ontology is designed to describe sequence homology data available 
in multiple Orthology databases in the Web (e.g.: <a href="https://omabrowser.org/oma/home/">OMA</a>,
 <a href="http://www.orthodb.org">OrthoDB</a>, <a href="http://hieranoidb.sbc.su.se">HieranoiDB</a>, and etc.). 
 By sequence homology data, we mean gene (region) and/or protein centric orthology, paralogy, and xenology 
   information. Depending on the database, the homology information  is structured in different ways. ORTH ontology
   accommodates these disparate data structures namely Hierarchical Orthologous Group (HOG),
    cluster of homologous sequences and homologous-pairwise relations between sequences.
