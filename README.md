# The Orthology Ontology
The need of a common ontology for describing orthology information in the biological research community leads to the creation of the Orthology Ontology on the basis of existing ontologies and the best practices in ontology construction. This ontology was developed in the Web Ontology Language ([OWL](http://www.w3.org/TR/owl2-overview/)) using [Protege](http://protege.stanford.edu). The mappings between OrthoXML and this ontology was defined using the Semantic Web Integration Tool ([SWIT](http://sele.inf.um.es/swit/)). This ontology should serve as a knowledge framework for semantic standardization of the orthology resources.
