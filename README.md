# OrthologyOntology
The need for a common ontology of orthology resources in the biological research community leads to the creation of the Orthology Ontology on the basis of existing ontologies and the best practices in constructing ontologies. The Orthology Ontology should serve as a knowledge framework for semantic standardization of the orthology resources.
